# 🏔️ Hiking MCP Server

This is an MCP (Modular Command Processor) server that allows you to search for hiking trails on **Wikiloc**, using geographic and textual queries.

---


## 🖥️ System Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed
- Python MCP SDK 1.2.0 or higher (included with `mcp[cli]`)
- Claude for Desktop (Windows or macOS only)

---

## ⚙️ Set Up Your Environment

### 1. Install `uv`

On **Windows PowerShell**:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

After installation, **restart your terminal** so the `uv` command is recognized.

---

### 2. Clone and configure the project

```bash
# Clone the GitHub repository
git clone https://github.com/Adriapt/hiking-mcp.git
cd hiking-mcp

# Set up and activate a virtual environment
uv venv
.venv\Scripts\activate   # On macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate

# Install required dependencies
uv add mcp[cli] httpx beautifulsoup4
```

---

## ▶️ Run the Server

To start the server, run:

```bash
uv run mcp-hiking
```

This will start the MCP server, ready to accept commands via `stdio`.

## 💻 Connect to Claude for Desktop

To use your MCP server with Claude for Desktop:

### 1. Ensure Claude for Desktop is installed

You can [download Claude for Desktop here](https://www.anthropic.com/index/claude-desktop).

### 2. Open or create the configuration file

- On **macOS**:

```bash
code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

- On **Windows** (PowerShell):

```powershell
code "$env:APPDATA/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json"
```

### 3. Add your MCP server configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hiking": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github/lanquarden/mcp-hiking",
        "mcp-hiking"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> Replace `/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/hiking-mcp` with the actual full path to your project directory.
>
> Use `where uv` on Windows or `which uv` on macOS/Linux to find the `uv` path if needed.
